# Portfolio website

A portfolio website based on Vue.js + Vue router and ASP.NET Core Web API. This website is used to show my personal information and some of my skills with a email system and visitor statistic system which could show the overall visitors. 

This project initially was based on pure ASP.NET Core MVC, and is currently migrating from Razor page to Vue.js.
Project has not finished yet, still under the developing mode.
